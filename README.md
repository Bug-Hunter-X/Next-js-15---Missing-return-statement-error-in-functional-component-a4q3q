# Next.js 15 - Missing Return Statement Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications:  a missing `return` statement in a functional component.  This often leads to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.  The `about.js` file contains the problematic code, and `aboutSolution.js` provides the fix.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You should see an error indicating a missing return statement.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a `return` statement to the functional component to return JSX or a value. See `aboutSolution.js` for the corrected code.
